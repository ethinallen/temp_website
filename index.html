      <h2>How I Feed Myself</h2>
      <p>For work, I'm a Developer Success Engineer at <a href="https://workos.com" class="highlight-workos">WorkOS</a>. I joined when the team was about 55 people &mdash; not the smallest company I've been at, but still very much a small team. Everyone is sharp and eager to help, and it's been a pleasure learning from some of the brightest minds in a setting that's fast-paced but immensely collaborative. Along the way, I've learned that nobody has it figured out, some more so than others, and that to make it to the top, you're going to need some help.</p>

      <h2>Where I Came From</h2>
      <p>I studied Industrial Engineering with an emphasis in computing at Clemson University, where I also ran for the Tigers. I attended Clemson's first hackathon and loved it so much I joined the organizing team, which helped me meet incredible people that fostered a love for CS and taught me the power of building a diverse team. What started as a curiosity became a calling when I was fortunate enough to be asked to lead the tech team my last year of CUhackit. This is where I learned that leadership isn't about being the most technical person in the room &mdash; it's about enabling those who are.</p>

      <h2>On Two Wheels</h2>
      <p>Outside of work, I'm a bicycle enjoyer. Without the chaos and urgency of cars, you're free to listen within as well as without &mdash; your heartbeat, the world around you, the quiet. By bike, the journey is truly meant to be enjoyed as much as the destination, and it comes at nobody's expense. After realizing how dangerous it was to ride in New Jersey, I took to the streets and started putting up fliers for what would become the first <a href="https://cmp.bike">critical mass in Princeton</a>. It's been an amazing ride that connected me with some really incredible people that help keep New Jersey rolling.</p>

      <h2>Accessibility</h2>
      <p>I care deeply about making the world a more accessible place &mdash; from the environments we engineer to the applications we make. Accessibility needs to be a first consideration rather than an afterthought, and I think this is something we collectively as a society are just learning how to do.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>What's Next</h2>
      <p>I keep an eye out for my next idea in case it's good enough to start a company of my own. Until then, I continue to learn from the amazing people on my team and anyone willing to share their experiences with me.</p>
